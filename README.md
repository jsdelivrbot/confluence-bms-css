# confluence-bms-css

When click Raw, the url is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/visakai/confluence-bms-css/master/bms-ci.css

The response Content-type is text/plain, which can not be recognized as CSS file

Need to replace raw.githubusercontent.com with rawgit.com

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/visakai/confluence-bms-css/bms-ci.css will respond the file as text/css
